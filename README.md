## This is the repository for f8ld the origami filter mask.
f8ld is a simple personal mask that can be folded from a single sheet of paper after a contour cut. It does not require glue. Fold is thought as a replacement for the simple medical mask and it features a filter. 
## Size and printing
You can print the pdf file print it either as a single sheet on an a3 printer or as as two a4/letter sheets.
The size of the mask can be controlled by scaling the print. The pdf as provided is for a large size mask. 
## Cut and fold
Cut allong the thick lines and score the mountain and valley dashed lines. Prefold the paper before starting the assembly. 
There is a legend in the pdf file. 
## Filter and fixation to the face
The mask needs a filter that can be made from any filtering material. In the provided images a piece from a medical mask is used.
You will also need to provide a string (preferably elastic) and tie is through the provided loopholes.
The mask (depending on the material used) can be reused with different filters. Once folded it can be unfolded for the filter change.
## This is not a professional mask!
This is not a professional N95 or FFP2/3 mask and it should not be compared to those. This is a personal mask designed to be affordable and easy to make. The f8ld mask has not been tested in a serious testing environment and has been built using only my expertise and common sense. I am not providing any warranty for its use and I cannot be held liable if it doesn't protect you from a disease or from any air contaminant. It is your responsibility to fold it carefully and add proper filtration material.
