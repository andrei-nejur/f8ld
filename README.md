This is the repository for f8ld the origami filter mask.
f8ld is a simple personal mask that can be folded from a single sheet of paper after a contour cut. It does not require glue. Fold is thought as a replacement for the simple medical mask and it features a filter. 
You can print the pdf file print it either as a single sheet on an a3 printer or as as two a4/letter sheets.
The size of the mask can be controled by scaling the print. The pdf as provided is for a large size mask. 
The mask needs a fiter that can be made from any filtering material. In the provided images a piece from a medical mask is used.
You will also need to provide a string (prefferably elastic) and tie is through the provided loopholes.
The maks (depending on the material used) can be reused with different filters. Once folde it can be unfolded for the filter change.
This is not a professional N95 or FFP2/3 mask and it should not be compared to those. This is a personal maks designed to be affordable and easy to make. The f8ld mask has not been tested in a serious testing environment and has been built using only my expertise and common sense. I am not providing any warranty for its use and I cannot be held liable if it doesn't protect you from a disease or from any air contaminant. It is your responsabilty to fold it carefully and add proper filtration material. 
This read.md is still a work in progress. Changes and additions are to be expected.
